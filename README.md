# university-portal-python
a "university portal" for Object Oriented Programming using python

Modelling through an UML class diagram the system for the
administrative management of university courses. 

Each course is followed by students and taught by lecturers. The latter may
be internal or external to the university. Only internal lecturers
may be responsible for the course. A lecturer may teach several
courses. Define apposite classes, with appropriate attributes
and methods, capable of representing the process. In particular,
at least, but not limited to, the following functions must be
represented:

• adding and removing a student's enrolment in the
course
• return of the teacher's name from the course code
• returning the name of courses taught by a lecturer from
the lecturer's course code.

In order to start you have to choose a student from the list of 5 default students. 
For example: name': 'BEHTASH KIANI', 'username': 'S0034118', 'password': '12318'
by using their unique username and password you can log into their account and add or remove
course from their study plan.

Note: some additional features has been removed from the codes like forget password and etc
